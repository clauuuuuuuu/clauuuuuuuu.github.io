honestly didnt expect this to be the first paper, as we only started writing it around 4 months ago

this is the outline we wrote on oct 9, peak yapper moment...

also im less excited than expected, but it's probably cuz this is just a narrative review (our team has been workng on much more novel stuff :p), and in the future we can definitely publish in more prestigous journals

a nice start nonetheless, so so grateful for my supervisors' trust and support
